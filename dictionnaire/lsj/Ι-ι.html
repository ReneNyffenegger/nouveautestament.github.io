 <b>Ι</b> <b>ι</b>, <i>ἰῶτα</i>, <i>τό</i>, indecl., tenth (later ninth) letter of the Gr. alphabet: as numeral <i>ι</i>ʹ = 10, but ͵<i>ι</i> = 10,000. The <i>ι</i> &#39;subscript&#39; of modern texts was said <i>προσγράφεσθαι</i>, cf. D.T.639.14, A.D.Pron.87.10, Ael.Dion.Fr.192 (also <i>τὸ</i> <i>ληιστής</i> (disyll.) . . <i>ἔχει</i> <i>προσκείμενον</i> <i>τὸ</i> <i>ῑ</i> Hdn.Gr.2.946), and this mode of writing is found in Papyri, Inscrr., and some medieval Mss. (e.g. cod. A of Plato, saec. ix, which has <i>τῶι</i> = <i>τῷ</i>, etc.); the present mode is found as early as the tenth century, and came into use in the thirteenth. This <i>ι</i> was prob. always pronounced up to ca. 150 B.C., but thereafter dropped in pronunciation, cf. D.T. l.c.; hence called <i>ι</i> <i>ἀνεκφώνητον</i> Choerob.in Theod.1.143 and freq. omitted in Pap. and Inscrr. (cf. Epigr. ap. Str.14.1.41, = SIG766), later freq. restored in writing, sts. in the wrong place (v. <i>ῥάθυμος</i>). From ca. 150 B.C. (at Argos from ca. 450 B.C., v. SIG56.13) <i>ει</i> was pronounced <i>ι</i> and the sound is written indifferently <i>ει</i> or <i>ι</i>.
