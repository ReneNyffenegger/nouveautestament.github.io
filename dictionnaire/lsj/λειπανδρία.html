 <b>λειπανδρία</b> and other compds. freq. written in medieval Mss. with <i>λειπ-</i> (<i>λειπο-</i>, <i>λειφ-</i>) will be found, with few exceptions, under <i>λῐπ</i> (<i>λῐπο-</i>, <i>λῐφ-</i>): metrical evidence, where available, favours <i>λῐπ-</i>, which is also certain in <i>λιποτελέω</i>: but <i>λειπ-</i> is certain in <i>λειπογνώμων</i>, and for many other words no trustworthy evidence of the spelling exists; cf. Choerob.in An.Ox.2.239.
