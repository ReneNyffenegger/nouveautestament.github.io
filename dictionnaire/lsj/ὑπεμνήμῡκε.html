 <b>ὑπεμνήμῡκε</b>, in Il.22.491, <i>πάντα</i> <i>δ’</i> <i>ὑπεμνήμυκε</i>, of an orphan boy: Aristarch. interpreted it—he hangs down his head utterly, he is altogether cast down; so that it must be taken (cf. Sch.) as Ep. pf. of <i>ὑπ-</i> <i>ημύω</i>, for <i>ὑπ-εμήμυκε</i> (<i>ν</i> being inserted metri gr.):—the pres. is used by Coluth.338, <i>ὑπημύουσι</i> <i>παρειαί</i> sink in, become hollow.
