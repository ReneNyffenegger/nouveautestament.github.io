 <b>Ϻ</b> (Greek name prob. <i>σάν</i> (v. <i>Σ</i> <i>σ</i> B. 2), eighteenth letter in the Etruscan abecedaria (IG14.2420) and probably in the oldest Gr. alphabets, occupying the same serial position as the Hebrew Tsade (צ, Phoenician <i>[</i>glyph variant of Phoenecian Sadi<i>]</i> 𐤑 Syria 6.103), with which it may be identified. In many of the oldest Gr. alphabets it represents the sound s, for which 𐌔 and <i>Σ</i> (twenty<i>-</i>first letter in the Etruscan abecedaria) is an alternative representation preferred in other Gr. alphabets. It is uncertain whether the letter ͳ (name and serial position unknown), which represents the sound <i>σσ</i> in Schwyzer 707 (Ephesus, vi B.C.), 701 A 17 (Erythrae, v B.C.), SIG4.6 (Cyzicus, vi B.C.), 45.2, al. (Halic., v B.C.) and the third sound (<i>σσ</i>?) in the name of Mesambria in BMus.Cat.Coins Thrace p.132, is to be identified with <i>Ϻ</i>. It is also uncertain whether the numerical symbol Ϡ (= 900), described by Gal.17(1).525, which has this form in PEleph.1 (iv B.C.), PCair.Zen.22.5 (iii B.C.), Rev.Phil.35.138 (Thessaly, iii B.C.), Milet.6.39 (ii B.C.), where it forms part of a symbol for thousands, and later the forms ͳ JHS26.287 (Athenian tesserae of iv B.C.), 25.342 (papyri of ii B.C.), SIG695.83 (Magn. Mae., ii B.C.), IG12(1).913 (Rhodes, i B.C.), <i>[</i>sampi glyph variant: #1535<i>]</i> ib.22.2776.11, al. (ii A.D.), and ϡ (medieval Mss., called <i>παρακύϊσμα</i> in Sch.D.T.p.496 H.), is to be identified with either of the foregoing. The numerical symbol, in the form <i>[</i>sampi glyph variant: #537<i>]</i>, follows <i>ω</i> in an Attic abecedarium, Bullettino dell&#39; Inst. di corrisp. archeol. 1867.75, and that position tallies with its numerical value, since <i>ω</i> = 800. The extended alphabet used by Archim.Spir.11, Aequil.2.3 for a diagram ends with <i>ω</i> ϡ ϟ .
