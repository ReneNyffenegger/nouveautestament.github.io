 <b>οὐθείς</b>, <i>οὐθέν</i>, later form for <i>οὐδείς</i>, <i>οὐδέν</i>, found in Att. Inscrr. from 378 B.C. onwards along with <i>οὐδείς</i>, which it supersedes entirely from about 325 B.C. to 100 B.C. (forty examples of <i>θ</i>, none of <i>δ</i>); <i>οὐθείς</i> is in a majority in Ptolemaic papyri up to about 130 B.C., after which <i>οὐδείς</i> begins to be common, but does not prevail until i A. D.; the evidence of non<i>-</i>Att. Inscrr. is in general agreement with the foregoing; codd. of Th., Antipho, And., Lys., and Hdt. never have <i>οὐθείς</i>, but the <i>θ</i> forms are freq. in those of Pl., X., Isoc., D., Hyp., Arist., and Thphr., freq. as variants for the <i>δ</i> forms; also in Hellenistic writers, Teles, Plb., etc.; the frequency of <i>θ</i> forms in the uncials of LXX varies roughly according to the date (known or probable) of the translation of the book in question (though the <i>δ</i> forms are in a large majority in the LXX as a whole); the <i>θ</i> forms are rare in codd. of Str. and later writers.
